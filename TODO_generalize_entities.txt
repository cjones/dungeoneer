situation:  entity stats (enemies and equipment) are hardcoded in the code. 

target: save all entity stats in files.  when adding enemies and equipment, access stats from files. Allow editing of files and updating of stats of new and existing enemies and equipment

proposal:  create two files,  enemies.py and equipment.py. add .updateinfo method to Object and assign the enemies or equipment file to be used for the update.
