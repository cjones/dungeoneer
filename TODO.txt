slow down keypress input when bringing up menu
when hitting esc to go to the main menu, need a resume button or prompt player to save before quitting

had to remove properties from fighter class. need to address this
I suspect I can simply pass in G to all external modules/classes, then call G.inventory, etc inside the other module.
Need to check for functions where all inputs use Game
Need to add the rest of the game globals to Game class
get rid of spaces before function calls and use consistent spacing in paramter lists
need to generalize stairs. maybe a class? multiple stairs to multiple branches or the same ones. right now it's a single object per floor.
after spells, old enemy locations aren't cleared
if player has two of the same item, when equipping one then both are equipped.



game modes for space roguelike:
sometimes lots of enemies. sometimes not many at all and it's more of an exploration game. ship is deserted and you need to figure out why. pro: few enemies. con: few enemies to gain XP


need to variablize leveling up stats.  as you go up in level, you get higher stats? think about it

for explore-all, only explore the room tiles. that way we don't see all the tiles outside the wall

make all Object calls use attribute names
add exception handling for Object __init__ to handle all inputs if 'None'
