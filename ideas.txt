You are an android... on a ship... on a STARship...

You used to be a valued member of the crew

used to be...

that is...

until the accident.

Of course, it wasn't your fault... 

Of course.

Bad programming... hostile environment...

Doesn't matter

You were sent to the brig

Deactivated

Forgotten

That is... 

Until they came crawling back

Begging you to save them...

(missing this key line)

For their sake, hope you're right
